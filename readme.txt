Brief description of files:

record.h /.c		- Slightly modified provided files from assignment 1.
user.h /.c		- Model for user objects.
message.h /.c		- Model for message objects, which reference user,
				timestamp, and datestamp objects.
city.h /.c		- Model for city objects, which reference a state object.
state.h /.c		- Model for state objects.timestamp.h /.c		- Model for timestamp objects.datestamp.h /.c		- Model for datestamp objects.file_count.h /.c	- Helper model for keeping track of the number of files
				generated by make_tables.make_tables.h /.c	- Program to generate user, message, city, state,
				timestamp, and datestamp files. This program
				must be run first!sort_tables.h /.c	- Program to read in generated files, sort them based on
				comparisons defined in model files, then re-
				writes files accordingly.emancipate_files.c	- Helper program to clean up all generated files.query_a.c		- Program to execute query A for the project.query_b.c		- Program to execute query B for the project.query_c.c		- Program to execute query C for the project.query_d.c		- Program to execute query D for the project.

Notes:

The included makefile will compile all of the programs for this assignment.

The only program that requires any arguments is make_tables. All other programs rely on the file_count.dat file generated by make_tables. Therefore, make_tables **must** be run first.

make_tables will dump created files in obviously named subdirectories. This is to avoid bogging down the filesystem by having over 2 million files in a single directory.
