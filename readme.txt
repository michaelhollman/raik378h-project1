Brief description of files:

record.h /.c		- Slightly modified provided files from assignment 1.
user.h /.c		- Model for user objects.
message.h /.c		- Model for message objects, which reference user,
				timestamp, and datestamp objects.
city.h /.c		- Model for city objects, which reference a state object.
state.h /.c		- Model for state objects.
timestamp.h /.c		- Model for timestamp objects.
datestamp.h /.c		- Model for datestamp objects.
file_count.h /.c	- Helper model for keeping track of the number of files
				generated by make_tables.
make_tables.h /.c	- Program to generate user, message, city, state,
				timestamp, and datestamp files. This program
				must be run first!
sort_tables.h /.c	- Program to read in generated files, sort them based on
				comparisons defined in model files, then re-
				writes files accordingly.

emancipate_tables.c	- Helper program to clean up all generated files.
emancipate_bplus.c	- Helper program to clean up all generated files.

query_a.c		- Program to execute query A for the project.
query_b.c		- Program to execute query B for the project.
query_c.c		- Program to execute query C for the project.
query_d.c		- Program to execute query D for the project.

bplus_query_a.c		- Program to execute query A for the project against B+ trees.
bplus_query_b.c		- Program to execute query B for the project against B+ trees.
bplus_query_c.c		- Program to execute query C for the project against B+ trees.
bplus_query_d.c		- Program to execute query D for the project against B+ trees.

bplus_roots.h / .c      - Helper file to keep track of B+ tree roots.
int_node.h / .c         - An individual node of a B+ tree.
make_bplus_trees.h / .c - Program to generate the B+ trees.

Notes:

The included makefile will compile all of the programs for this assignment.

The only program that requires any arguments is make_tables. All other programs rely on the file_count.dat file generated by make_tables. Therefore, make_tables **must** be run first.

make_tables and make_bplus_trees will dump created files in obviously named subdirectories. This is to avoid bogging down the filesystem by having over 2 million files in a single directory.

To change the fanout of the B+ trees, change the defined constant in int_node.h and recompile the programs.
